# Grievance and Member Interaction Companion App

The GMIC will be used to digitize the arduous task of keeping track of Grievances and Member interactions in order to facilitate better communication between the union and it's membership.  

Also due to a lack of adequate means to keep track of grievances effectively it is important to create an electronic medium wholely capable of keeping track of them and while following union/management agreed upon grievance choronological timeline.
